# 鲁棒控制理论 Robust Control
## Definitions
**Robust control** is not a specific controller like PID or full state feedback,instead it's a a design method,it's a set of tools that allow us to choose PID games or full state feedback games or to tune some other controller so that it is robust

A system is robust if it's capable of meeting requirements usually **stability** or **performance measures** even in the presence of **model or disturbance uncertainty.**

don't konw my system perfectly or the environment is complex ---don't worry,it will work out with the help of our robust control system!

problems that we meet when design a control system:the mathematical model we use is probably wrong
    + system is too complex and model can't be comprehensible
    + system can vary with the flow of time
    + ...
